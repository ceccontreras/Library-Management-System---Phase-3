**Library Management System (LMS) - Phase 3**
**Overview**
Phase 3 of the Library Management System focuses on integrating a SQLite database to manage book records. This phase enhances the functionality of the LMS by allowing data persistence and real-time database interaction through a user-friendly GUI built in Java Swing.

The system now includes features such as adding, removing, checking in, and checking out books, with updates reflected directly in the database.

**Key Features**
Database-Driven System: All book records are stored and managed in a SQLite database.
Real-Time Updates: Changes to the database are visible immediately in the application.
GUI Integration: A Java Swing-based interface enables easy interaction with the database.
